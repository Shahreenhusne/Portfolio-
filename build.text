To successfully deploy a Next.js project with the App Router on Netlify after customizing the next.config.js file to use dist as the build output directory, follow these steps:

Step 1: Update next.config.js for Netlify Compatibility
Ensure your next.config.js includes the necessary configurations for Next.js and Netlify:

javascript
Copy code
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  distDir: 'dist', // Custom output directory for the build
  experimental: {
    appDir: true, // Enable the App Router
  },
};
Step 2: Install the Netlify Plugin for Next.js
Netlify requires a specific plugin to handle Next.js's advanced features like dynamic routing and server-side rendering.

Install the Plugin:
bash
Copy code
npm install @netlify/plugin-nextjs
Step 3: Create a netlify.toml File
Add a netlify.toml file in the root of your project to configure the Netlify deployment:

toml
Copy code
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist" # Ensure this matches your custom output directory

[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"
Step 4: Add a _redirects File
Netlify needs a _redirects file to properly handle routing for dynamic pages. Add this file to your public/ directory:

_redirects Content:
perl
Copy code
# Redirect all routes to the Next.js app
/*    /.netlify/functions/next    200
Step 5: Ensure Dynamic Routes Are Handled Correctly
If you're using dynamic routes in the App Router, ensure:

You’re generating the necessary paths with generateStaticParams (for static builds).
You’re using server-side rendering (generateMetadata or fetch) for dynamic paths.
